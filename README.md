# Python Data Projects

Welcome to the Python Data Projects repository! This collection showcases various simple projects that illustrate basic Python programming concepts, with a focus on data manipulation and processing. 

## Projects Overview

This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook projects:

1. **Movie Ticket Sale and Donation to Charity**: A program that calculates total ticket sales and the amount donated to charity based on user input.
  
2. **Cable Bill Calculator**: A simulation that calculates a customerâ€™s bill for residential and business services, including basic fees and premium channel costs.

3. **Simple ATM Simulation**: An ATM simulation that allows users to deposit money, withdraw cash, check balances, and change their PIN code.

4. **Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) Simulation**: A simple simulation of an electronic voting machine that collects votes for various parties and displays the results.

## Learning Objectives

Through these projects, I've gained experience in:
- Basic Python programming
